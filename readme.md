Instructions for use...
1. download the .ahk file from this repository. Save it wherever you'd like.
2. Navigate to where you saved the file.
3. Double-click the file to run the script
4. Now, whenever you're in-game, toggle the show/hide features of the script, using the "HOME" key (to show the overlay) and the "END" key (to hide the overlay).

Note: The Home/End keys will only work while in-game. Pressing them outside of the poe window will do nothing (as to avoid interfering with your non-poe keyboard functionality, while the script is running). 

Hope it makes things a bit more convenient for you guys!
